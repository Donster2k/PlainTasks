## [PlainTasks](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks)

A modified version of the PlainTasks todo-list plugin for Sublime Text (2 & 3) editor. This version extends PlainTasks by adding in the ability to generate new todo files based on an exiting one. The new file is opened and named with todays date. All un-archived tasks are brought into the new task file.


Open yesterdays todo file and use **`âŒ˜ + shift + i`** to create the new todo list file for today.


Please refer to the [original plugin](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks) for further information on installation and use.
